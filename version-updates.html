    <h2><ins>V 1.0</ins></h2>
    <p>
        Project first uploaded to Github and linked to Cloudflare Pages.<br>
        Just the scripts and styles files, index, json database and one (test) song "E rasboi frate".
    </p>

    <h2><ins>V 1.1</ins></h2>
    <p>Updated first song with corrected chords selection, created "template.html" file, corrected homepage view on phones.</p>
    <div style="margin-left: 15px;">
        <h3>V 1.1.1</h3>
        <p>Hotfix: songs were not displaying on the homepage (wrong hypelink nomeclature).</p>
    </div>

    <h2><ins>V 1.2</ins></h2>
    <p>Now users can print a song's page more comfortably, and the non-necessary stuff will be left out, leaving only the song (and musical chords).</p>
    <div style="margin-left: 15px;">
        <h3>V 1.2.1</h3>
        <p>Fixed stuff, change HTML language to Romanian.</p>
        <h3>V 1.2.2</h3>
        <p>
            When printing, added a the top the song's title in red. <br>
            Also added the possibility to bettere align the chords above the lyrics.
        </p>
    </div>
    <h2><ins>V 1.3</ins></h2>
    <p>
        With the latest update (v 1.2.2), corrected the test-song's chords' position. <br>
        Also changed the sidebar's padding, to occupy less space on mobile devices. (80px -> 65px) <br>
        Updated the template.
        Scaled the UI so the index and version history are more readable (25%), and the songs are 50% bigger; <br>
        this also helps when printing the song ( body { ... width: 75%;} ), such that, by default, it is bigger.
    </p>
    <div style="margin-left: 15px;">
        <h3>V 1.3.1</h3>
        <p>
            Typos: ("rÄƒzboi", not "rasboi", duh). <br>
            Changed the scale of index and version history to 1,2. <br>
            Changed scrollbar padding and margins even more. <br>
            Changed songs' scale to 1,35, otherwise it's too big on mobile; <br>
            added a style attribute for each song, for optimal printing conditions (updated template).
