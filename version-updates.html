    <h2><ins>V 1.4</ins></h2>
    <p>
        Added favicons.
    </p>
    <div style="margin-left: 15px;">
        <h3>V 1.4.1</h3>
        <p>Added website description (e.g. when using Google search).</p>
        <h3>V 1.4.2</h3>
        <p>Revision and rearrangement of version history tab.</p>
    </div>

    <h2><ins>V 1.3</ins></h2>
    <p>
        With the latest update (v 1.2.2), corrected the test-song's chords' position. <br>
        Also changed the sidebar's padding, to occupy less space on mobile devices. <br>
        Updated the template.
        Scaled the UI so the index and version history are more readable, and the songs' pages are now bigger; <br>
        this also helps when printing the song ( body { ... width: 75%;} ), such that, by default, it is bigger.
    </p>
    <div style="margin-left: 15px;">
        <h3>V 1.3.1</h3>
        <p>
            Typos: ("război", not "rasboi", duh). <br>
            Changed the scale of index and version history. <br>
            Changed scrollbar padding and margins even more. <br>
            Changed songs' scale, otherwise it's too big on mobile; <br>
            added a style attribute for each song, for optimal printing conditions (updated template).
        </p>
        <h3>V 1.3.2</h3>
        <p>
            Hotfix: corrected scaling and page width, still testing for mobile devices.
        </p>
        <h3>V 1.3.3</h3>
        <p>
            Hotfix: corrected scaling and page width, and grammar on test-song.
        </p>
    </div>

    <h2><ins>V 1.2</ins></h2>
    <p>Now users can print a song's page more comfortably, and the non-necessary stuff will be left out, leaving only the song (and musical chords).</p>
    <div style="margin-left: 15px;">
        <h3>V 1.2.1</h3>
        <p>Fixed stuff, change HTML language to Romanian.</p>
        <h3>V 1.2.2</h3>
        <p>
            When printing, added at the top the song's title in red. <br>
            Also added the possibility to better align the chords above the lyrics.
        </p>
    </div>

    <h2><ins>V 1.1</ins></h2>
    <p>Updated first song with corrected chords selection, created "template.html" file, corrected homepage view on phones.</p>
    <div style="margin-left: 15px;">
        <h3>V 1.1.1</h3>
        <p>Hotfix: songs were not displaying on the homepage (wrong hypelink nomeclature).</p>
    </div>
    
    <h2><ins>V 1.0</ins></h2>
    <p>
        Project first uploaded to Github and linked to Cloudflare Pages.<br>
        Just the scripts and styles files, index, json database and one (test) song "E război frate".
