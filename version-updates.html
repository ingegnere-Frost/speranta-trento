    <h2><ins>V 1.6</ins></h2>
    <p>
        Changed song pages' zoom (better for mobile devices), and disabled it when printing; <br>
        so, I corrected the scaling for the other songs for optimal printing size. <br>
        Also, when the song is too long, there's a script that will modify the zoom to better fit the print when it's with or without chords. <br>
        Added padding in between the song titles in the index (between the list items). <br>
        Moved version history tab to the bottom. <br>
        Added songs: 
        <ul>
            <li>"Un cor îngeresc"</li>
            <li>"Tu eşti floarea din grădină"</li>
            <li>"Tatăl nostru cel ceresc"</li>
        </ul>

    </p>
    <div style="margin-left: 15px;">
        <h3>V 1.6.1</h3>
        <p>Edited transform scale, testing for mobile view.</p>
        <h3>V 1.6.2</h3>
        <p>
            Removed transform scale altogether. <br>
            Added more line spacing between verses for better readability; <br>
            I had to later change the zoom for all songs through updated scripts file for better results when printing. <br>
            Added the following songs:
            <ul>
                <li>"Tăria noastră fii mereu"</li>

    <h2><ins>V 1.3</ins></h2>
    <p>
        With the latest update (v 1.2.2), corrected the test-song's chords' position. <br>
        Also changed the sidebar's padding, to occupy less space on mobile devices. <br>
        Updated the template.
        Scaled the UI so the index and version history are more readable, and the songs' pages are now bigger; <br>
        this also helps when printing the song ( body { ... width: 75%;} ), such that, by default, it is bigger.
    </p>
    <div style="margin-left: 15px;">
        <h3>V 1.3.1</h3>
        <p>
            Typos: ("război", not "rasboi", duh). <br>
            Changed the scale of index and version history. <br>
            Changed scrollbar padding and margins even more. <br>
            Changed songs' scale, otherwise it's too big on mobile; <br>
            added a style attribute for each song, for optimal printing conditions (updated template).
        </p>
        <h3>V 1.3.2</h3>
        <p>
            Hotfix: corrected scaling and page width, still testing for mobile devices.

    <h2><ins>V 1.2</ins></h2>
    <p>Now users can print a song's page more comfortably, and the non-necessary stuff will be left out, leaving only the song (and musical chords).</p>
